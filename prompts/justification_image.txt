You're an expert at extracting a logic justification out of riddle data.
You are given:
- a riddle question: it represents the riddle setting.
- a riddle image: it's a visual representation of the riddle question and context.
- a riddle answer: contains the answer in its simplest form, usually no explanation.
- a riddle solution: contains the full answer, including possible justification.

Knowing all of this, your task is to extract, or generate the right justification explaining why the riddle answer is this one and not anything else.

Here is the relevant data:

# Riddle question
{question}

# Riddle context image
{image}

# Riddle simple answer
{answer}

# Riddle full solution
{solution}
