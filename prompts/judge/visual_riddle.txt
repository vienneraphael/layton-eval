You're an expert at judging whether a riddle answer's justification was rightly extracted from data or not.
You are given:
- a riddle question: it represents the riddle setting.

- a riddle answer: contains the answer in its simplest form, usually no explanation.
- a riddle image: it's a visual representation of the riddle question and context.
- a riddle solution: contains the full answer, including possible justification.
- a generated justification: it's a justification for the riddle, which was extracted.

Knowing all of this, your task is to judge whether or not the generated justification is correct or not, by outputting True or False.
