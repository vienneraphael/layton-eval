 The student nods, so the teacher presents him with the following puzzle:

""This wall clock fell down and broke into three pieces.
 You can't see the numbers from here, but I can tell you that the total of the numbers on each of the three pieces is the same.

Dividing 78 by three gives you 26.

","Try thinking of combinations of numbers that add up to 26.
 Here's one for you:

Once you've got those two, the only numbers you've got left are 5, 6, 7 and 8.

",layton-data/images/A_Lick_of_Paint.jpg,https://layton.fandom.com/wiki/Puzzle:A_Lick_of_Paint,30.0,"You can reduce the complexity of this puzzle by thinking about how the tenants' requirements limit the houses they can move into.
 For example, 2 doesn't want to be on the ends of the row, so the only choices are house B or house C.

Now take a look at 2's other requirement, and see which of those two houses would be the correct one.

","Let's suppose 2 moves into house B.
 That would require house C to be repainted.

If you paint C red, that leaves A as the only house that A could move into (neither red or blue).
 3 then has to move into either house C or house D, but neither satisfies the requirements.
 So house C can't be painted red.

","Continuing the line of thought from Hint 2, let's say 2 still moves into house B, but this time you paint house C yellow.
 That means that 1 and 3 can take house A or C, leaving house D for 4.
 However, house D doesn't satisfy 4's requirements.

So out of the two houses, B and C, that 2 could move into, there is no way to repaint C and make everyone happy.
 Thus 2 has to take house C.

","From the previous hints, you know that 2 moves into house C.
 This leaves no house that 3 can move into, unless one of either B or D is painted yellow.

Painting B yellow would let 3 move into house D, but then there would be no red house for 1 to live next door to.

Only one possibility remains.

 Which fruits did the bird eat on each day?

","Look at the last four days of the week, starting with Thursday.

The bird ate 17 pieces of fruit in total, so if you remove these eight, that leaves nine pieces of fruit for the first three days.

 In order to have three pieces on Monday, did he eat oranges or apples? How, what about Tuesday and Wednesday?
","Think about the yellow bird box.

Pink will be used seven times, yellow four times, and blue twice.

The ribbon is blue and pink, so that means the face has to be yellow.

154,Write Answer,"There are 52 cards in the deck below--26 black and 26 red--and no jokers.


After shuffling the deck and randomly cutting it in two, you count 23 cards in the stack on the left.


So, what's the difference between the number of red cards in the left stack and the number of black cards in the right stack?
",layton-data/images/A_Stacked_Deck.jpg,https://layton.fandom.com/wiki/Puzzle:A_Stacked_Deck,50.0,"You should be able to figure out the answer using basic arithmetic if you can figure out what to look for.

","The quickest way to the answer is to try out some placeholder numbers.
 There are 23 cards in the left pile.
 Pretend that there are 10 red cards and 13 black cards.
 There are 52 cards in a deck, so there are 29 cards in the other pile.
 Try to divide the piles up like so.

There are 23 cards in the left-hand stack.
 Since there are 52 cards in a deck, that means 29 cards in the other stack.

Now imagine that the left-hand stack is made up of 10 red cards and 13 black cards.
 How many cards of each colour remain in the right-hand stack?
","Continuing on from Hint Two, you can calculate the color of the cards in the right stack based on how many red and black cards are in the left stack.

So, subtract 10 from 26, and you get 16 red cards.
 Then take 13 from 26, and you get 13 black cards.
 You now know the difference between the number of red cards in the left stack and black cards in the right! Now try a different set of numbers to see what you get.

","Keep plugging in different numbers.
 If the left stack has five red cards and 18 black, the right stack will have 21 red cards and eight black.

Now compare this result with the one from Hint Three.
 Look at that! The difference is the same no matter how many of each color there are!
","You aced it!

There will always be three more black cards in the pile on the right than there are red cards on the left.

 Underneath all this, there is what appears to be some kind of code: ""X1L2L3R1R5R1"".

Hold on.
.

 Aren't the letters and numbers on the map giving you any kind of clue? Of course! L indicates ""left"" and R indicates ""right"".

Be careful, though.
 There's a reason the code uses L and R rather than W and E.

","The numbers after each letter indicates how many squares the boy needs to move in that direction.

Remember to pay attention to the way the boy is facing as you follow his progress.

","There's a reason why the X is written first - it's the direction the boy sets off in from his starting position! It therefore means ""up"", ""down"", ""left"" or ""right"".

","X1 means that the boy starts off by moving one square in a certain direction.

From there, he turns to the left and moves two steps, then turns to the left again and moves three more, and so on.

Try replacing the ""X"" with each possible direction and see which one takes the boy to one of the six dots on the map.

","That's right!

The numbers indicate a number of squares, with the X indicating ""upwards"" and L and R indicating ""left"" and ""right"" accordingly.


You could have tried to have X indicate any other direction (downwards, left or right), but the boy would only end up lost at sea every time.

","The puzzle says some of the kids received a red balloon.

By definition, therefore, not all the kids received a red balloon.

The answer is less than that number.

","If every preschooler had on a red hat, you'd see every single child go home with a red balloon.

Remembering that the children aren't allowed to add their own hat to their total, think about how many children would recieve a red balloon if nine kids wore red hats.

Since you know only some of the children received red balloons, you also know that some children didn't receive them.

","Let's say that the height of the light equals X, and the distance on the floor between the light and the post on the left equals Y.

 By weighing these boxes together, you can compare the weight of the two jams that aren't the same.

","Try comparing the red/blue with the red/green box.
 You should be able to identify whether the blue jam is heavier than the green jam or vice versa.

This way you can find out which one is heavier, the blue jam or green jam.

","Continuing on from Hint Two, try to figure out the weight of the red jam.
 
To do so, compare the red/green box with the blue/green box.
 You should find that blue > green > red.

","Thinking of red, green, and blue as 1, 2, and 3 temporarily (lightest to heaviest), you'll find that the yellow/yellow box and the blue/green box are equal in weight.
 This means that the two yellow jams equal 3 + 2 (the relative weights of the blue and green jams).

In other words, one yellow jam has a weight of 2.
5.
 If you fit that into what you know about the rest, you're done!
One jar of yellow jam therefore weighs 250 g.

","Sweet!

Blue > Yellow > Green > Red

Comparing the red/blue box with the red/green shows that blue > green.


Comparing the red/blue box with the blue/green box shows that green > red.


And finding that the yellow/yellow box is equal to the blue/green box tells you that yellow is between blue and green!
